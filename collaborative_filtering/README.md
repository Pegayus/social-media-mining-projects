# Collaborative Filtering
**Caution: Running this code on a normal PC takes time!**
Implementation of a movie rating prediction program for both item-based and user-based collaborative filtering on the MovieLens 20M Dataset available [here](http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)
The program takes as input a user-item matrix (same format as ratings.csv), the neigh-
borhood size, a user id 'u', and an item-id 'i' .
Output:
Predicted rating for both user-based CF and item-based CF
